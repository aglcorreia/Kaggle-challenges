# ASHRAE Energy Prediction Challenge
 - Repository to upload code for the ASHRAE Energy Prediciton challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction)
 - The idea in this repository can be to upload .py scripts for version control as well as the original notebook file
 - The creation of these .py scripts can be done automatically by saving the jupyter_notebook_config.py file in the project directory where you start your Jupyter Lab (as suggested in https://towardsdatascience.com/version-control-for-jupyter-notebook-3e6cef13392d)
